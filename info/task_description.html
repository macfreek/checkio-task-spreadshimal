<p>
    <tt>A B C D ... X Y Z AA AB AC ... AY AZ BA BB ... ZY ZZ AAA AAB ...</tt>
</p>

<p><i>"This looks like a hexavigesimal base system"</i></p>

<p><i>"A what?," replied Nikola.</i></p>

<p><i>
  "A base-26 numeral system. You know, like binary (base-2), decimal (base-10)
  or hexadecimal (base-16). Remember from <a href="/mission/good-radix/">The
  Good Radix</a>? There are 26 symbols here, so this is a hexavigesimal
  numeral system!"
</i></p>

<p><i>
  Nikola looks carefully at the list. "I don't think so. If <tt>A</tt> is a 0,
  what is <tt>AA</tt> doing after the <tt>Z</tt>? I think <tt>A</tt> is 1,
  and <tt>Z</tt> is 26. So this must be a heptavigesimal numeral system, and
  the 0 at the start is not shown."
</i></p>

<p><i>
  "That can't be right either! If this is a heptavigesimal numeral system, the
  symbol after the <tt>Z</tt> should be <tt>A0</tt> instead of <tt>AA</tt>.
  I think it's neither a hexavigesimal nor a heptavigesimal numeral system.
  It's a <b>spreadshimal</b> numeral system!"

<p>
  Your task is to implement the spreadshimal numeral system. Given a number, 
  return the label on the n<sup>th</sup> column in the spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> One arguments. An integer <em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A string. The representation of 
    <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> spreadshimal in capital letters. If n is zero, 
    an empty string. If n &lt; 0, the <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> spreadshimal 
    number prepended with a minus symbol ('-').

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    <i>spreadshimal numbers are used in columns of spreadsheets, and may
